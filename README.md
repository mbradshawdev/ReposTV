Continuously reposition an instance MPC-HC Instance to upper section of any screen
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AutoHotKey script to mitigate the problem of having a partially obscured TV screen tucked away in a weird spot!
Works with prominent video files in my favourite video player 'MPC-HC' but could be modified to work with any program.
Posting here to demonstrate my improving coding ability (pls give me a job) and to keep active on here.
And if anyone actually reads this: Any feedback/improvements/suggestions/employment welcome! Thanks!
